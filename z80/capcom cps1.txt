CPS-1 the detail

The design consist of a number of interconnected pcbs known as A, B and the later added C board and Q-sound board. Here's a description of each layer:

A: the base board containing most of the system hardware. eg: cpu, memory, sound, etc...
B: the game rom board containing a combined number of mask roms and/or eproms.
C (later added): an small satellite board containing a video logic custom chip, and sometimes additional IO.
QSound (later added): a full size intermediate board providing new sound capabilities, the board is sandwiched in between A and B.


Note: C board was introduced right after the two initial game releases: Forgotten Worlds & Ghosts and Ghouls, and wasn't part of the original CPS-1 design. Instead, its contents were an integral part of the B board.

The CPS1 uses a dedicated Z80 CPU for sound processing. Aside from sending commands to the Z80, the main m68k CPU doesn't interact with it at all. The Z80 intefaces with the Yamaha, Oki and m68k CPU with addresses beginning 0xf000.

The Z80 address map is:

Start	End	
0x0000	0x7fff	Z80 Code ROM
0x8000	0xbfff	Bank-switched access to bytes 0x8000-0xffff of the above code ROM
0xd000	0xd7ff	RAM
0xf000	0xf001	Yamaha YM2151
0xf002	0xf002	Oki MSM6295
0xf004	0xf004	Bank switch register
0xf006	0xf006	Controls pin 7 of the Oki
0xf008	0xf008	Sound command register from m68k CPU
0xf00a	0xf00a	Sound fade timer from m68k CPU
While the Z80 is a little-endian CPU, addresses of tracks and instruments are in big-endian format, requring byte-swapping when being read into Z80 register pairs. My guess is the tune programs were dumped from tools running on a big-endian Sharp X68000, and Capcom decided to do the endian swapping at run time.
